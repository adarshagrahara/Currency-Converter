THe name of our project is called Currency Converter.

Our project is able to convert USD into the mainstream currencies that are being used right now.

We designed this project for anyone that wants to see java in action!

Our interest was java itself. It a language that we all knew and it inspired us to do something about java itself!

Some challanges that we ran into was trying to expand our project, to other parts, but it just didnt seem to work out.

I think we could have tried to make this into a website and integrate javascript and html with java

Our team learned how to time manage and get our work done effeciently.
